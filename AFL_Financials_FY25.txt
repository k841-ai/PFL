Key Audit Matter
How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit
Allowance for expected Credit Loss on Loans (refer note no. 6) ("ECL")
As at March 31, 2025, the carrying value of loan assets measured at amortised cost, aggregated ₹ 36,75,276 lakhs (net of allowance of expected credit loss ₹ 53,919 lakhs) constituting approximately 93% of the Company's total assets. Significant judgement is used in classifying these loan assets and applying appropriate measurement principles. ECL on such loan assets measured at amortised cost is a critical estimate involving greater level of management judgement. As part of our risk assessment, we determined that the ECL on such loan assets has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes for the Ind AS financial statements. The elements of estimating ECL which involved increased level of audit focus are the following:
· Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the loan assets measured at amortised cost;
Rasis used
for estimating Probabilities of Default ("PD"), Loss Given Default ("LGD") and Exposure at Default ("EAD") at product level with past trends;
· Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios and probability weights applied to
Our Audit Approach:
Our audit approach was a combination of test of internal controls and substantive procedures which included the following:
a) Evaluating the Company's accounting policies, as approved by the Board of Directors, for impairment of Financial Instruments.
b) Obtained an understanding of the modelling techniques / models adopted by the Company including the key inputs and assumptions.
c) Tested the design and effectiveness of controls related to:
· The completeness and accuracy of Exposure at Default (EAD) and the classification of such exposure into stages, as per the Board-approved policy.
. The accuracy and relevance of information used in estimating Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD).

underlying data based on which the ECL estimates have been computed.
f) We also made management enquiries with respect to the overlay quantum.
2 Information Technology (IT) System and Controls
The Company's key financial accounting and reporting processes are highly dependent on the automated controls over the Company's information systems, such that there exists a risk that gaps in the IT general control environment could result in a misstatement of
the financial accounting and reporting records. Proper IT general and application controls are essential to ensure accurate, complete, and consistent data processing for reliable financial reporting Accordingly, we have considered user access management, segregation of duties and controls over system change over key financial accounting and reporting systems, as a key audit matter

Our Audit Approach:
With the assistance of our IT specialists, we obtained an understanding of the Company's IT applications, databases and operating systems relevant to financial reporting and the control environment.
Our audit approach was a combination of test of internal controls and substantive procedures on the areas of the IT infrastructure, which majorly focused access security (including controls over privileged access), program change controls, database management and network operations.
In particular, our activity included the following:
General IT controls design, observation and operation:
> Understood the changes made in the IT environment during the year and ascertained its effect on the financial statements controls and accounts.
> Tested key controls operating over the information technology in relation to financial accounting and reporting systems, including system access and system change management, program development and computerRADIA operations.

> Further, we assessed the operating effectiveness of controls over granting, removal and appropriateness of access rights.
Application controls:
> We tested the design and operating effectiveness of automated controls critical to financial accounting and reporting.
> For any identified deficiencies, tested the design and operating effectiveness of compensating controls and, where necessary, extended the scope of our substantive audit procedures.
> Our tests also included testing of the compensating controls or alternate procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materiality impact the Ind AS Financial Statements.
Information Other than the Ind AS Financial Statements and Auditors' Report thereon
5. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's Directors' Report including Annexures to Board's Report, Management Discussion and Analysis and Report on Corporate Governance but does not include the Ind AS Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon.
Our opinion on the Ind AS Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Ind AS Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Ind AS Financial Statementsvorouxl

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management's responsibility for the Ind AS Financial Statements
6. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act, with respect to the preparation of these Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
7. In preparing the Ind AS Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
8. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the Ind AS Financial Statements
9. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Ind AS Financial Statements.
10. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

C
B. K. Khare & Co. Chartered Accountants
G. M. Kapadia & Co. Chartered Accountants
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
10.2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
10.3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
10.4 Conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Ind AS Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
10.5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Ind AS Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Ind AS Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
11. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
12. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
13. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should Chalfen of be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so

would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements under Clause (i) of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Axis Finance Limited ("the Company") as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025 based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting ("the Guidance Note") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAI').
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to financial statements includes those policies and procedures that:
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Ind AS financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Ind AS financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Ind AS financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The cost attributable to the services rendered by the employees of the Company is recognised as employee benefits expenses in profit or loss.
3.2 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits and short-term liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
3.3 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
3.3.1 Initial recognition and initial measurement
All financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial instruments are added to the fair value. Purchases or sales of financial instruments that require delivery of assets / liabilities within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset / liabilities.
3.3.2 Initial recognition, classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets
Based on the Business Model, the contractual characteristics of the financial assets and specific elections where appropriate, the financial assets are classified into one of the three categories for measurement and income recognition: -Amortized Cost (AC)
-Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) -Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
Financial asset is carried at amortized cost,
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both the following conditions :
a) The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows; and
b) The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).
KAPAD
After initial measurement and based on the assessment of the business model as asset held to collect contractual cash flows and SPPI, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective/interest rate ('EIR') method. Interest income and impairment expenses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the EIR method. Any gain and loss on derecognition s also recognised in statement of profit and loss.

The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest over the relevant period. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows (including all fees paid or received that form an integral part of the EIR, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
Further other things remain the same (as in (a) and (b) above), if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, such asset/s are classified as held at FVOCI.
Financial assets included within the FVOCI category are measured subsequently at each reporting date at fair value. Interest income and impairment loss are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Fair value movements on subsequent measurement are recognised in the OCI.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
In case of a financial asset that does not meet both the above conditions, it is classified as FVTPL.
Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured subsequently at each reporting date at fair value. Net gain or loss, including interest and other income are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
a) Business Model (BM) Assessment
In order to arrive at the appropriate Business Model, the following factors are considered by the Company.
-How the performance of the business model (including the financial assets in that business model) are evaluated and reported to key management personnel within the Company.
-The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets in it) and how those risks are managed.
Changes in Business Model
The Company periodically reviews and updates the existing business model for its portfolio as long as these changes are expected to be infrequent, significant to the entity's operations, and demonstrable to external parties.
b) Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) Test
Contractual Cash Flow Assessment
To determine whether a financial asset is measured at either amortized cost or FVOCI, the Company has considered whether the cash-flows from the financial asset are solely for the payments of principal and interest ("SPPI").
For the purpose of Ind AS 109, principal and interest are defined as follows:
-Principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition
-Interest is consideration for: -The time value of money
K-Credit risk associated with the principal amount -In addition, interest may also include consideration for other basic lending risks such as liquidity risk Moi posts ho holding the asset (eg administrative costs)

If the contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding then the SPPI criteria is met.
The Company classifies its financial assets into the following four categories:
-Debt instruments at amortized cost
-Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
-Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) -Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
3.3.3 Initial measurement, classification and subsequent measurement of Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments
The Company classifies these instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms of the instruments.
Equity
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the face value and proceeds received in excess of the face value are recognised as securities premium.
Financial liabilities
The Company's borrowings include bonds, commercial paper, borrowings from banks, etc. Debt securities issued, subordinated liabilities and other borrowings are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at their amortised cost using the EIR method.
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial liability is based on their classification. The Company's most of the Financial Liabilities are measured initially and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
3.3.4 De-recognition of Financial Assets and Liabilities
a) De-recognition of Financial Assets
A financial asset is derecognized only when
-The Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or -Retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.
Where the company has transferred an asset, the company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. Where the company has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognized.
Where the company has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognized if the company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the company retains the control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognized to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.
b) De-recognition of Financial Liabilities
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially

different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
3.3.5 Reclassification of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, apart from the exceptional circumstances in which the Company acquires, disposes of, or terminates a business line or in the period the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets. The classification and measurement requirements related to the new category apply prospectively from the first day of the first reporting period following the changes in the business model that results in reclassification.
Reclassifications are expected to be very infrequent. Such changes must be determined by the Company's senior management as a result of external or internal changes and must be significant to the Company's operations and demonstrable to external parties.
Further re- classification is not allowed in following cases; -Investments in equity instruments irrevocably designated as at FVOCI cannot be reclassified. -Reclassification of financial liabilities.
3.3.6 Impairment of Financial Assets - General approach
The Company records allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) for all loans and debt investments, together with loan commitments to customers.
The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset, unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case the allowance is based on the 12 months' expected credit loss. The 12 month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs an assessment of whether the loan's / investment's credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the asset. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on a provision matrix which takes into account the Company's historical credit loss experience, current economic condition, forward looking information and scenario analysis.
The expected credit loss is a product of Exposure at Default (EAD), Probability of Default (PD) and Loss given default (LGD). The Company has devised an internal model to evaluate the PD and LGD based on the parameters set out in Ind AS 109. Accordingly, the financial assets have been segmented into three stages based on their risk profiles. The three stages reflect the general pattern of credit deterioration of a financial asset.
The company categorizes financial assets at the reporting date into stages based on the days past due (DPD) status as under:
Stage 1: 0 to 30 days past due
- Stage 2: 31 to 60 days past due and 61 to 90 days past due
- Stage 3: more than 90 days past due
Probability of Default (PD): It is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. In order to estimate the PDs, studies on defaults available in public domain and experience of the Parent (Axis Bank Limited) have been taken into account.
Exposure at Default (EAD): EAD is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayment of principal and interest, whether contractually scheduled or otherwise and expected drawdown on committed loan facilities and accrued interest from missed payments. A credit conversion factor of 10% is applied for expected drawdown on committed loan facilities. CE

Loss Given Default (LGD): LGD is an estimate of the loss arising in case where a default occurs. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company would expect to receive, including from the realization of any security.
Credit - impaired Financial Assets A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events, that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset, have occurred. Credit-impaired financial assets are categorized to as Stage 3 assets. Evidence of credit-impairment includes observable data about the following events:
· Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
· A breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
. Grant of concession given by the lender to the borrower on account of relating to the borrower's financial difficulty economic or contractual reason which otherwise would not be consider;
· The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties; or
. The purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.
It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event, instead, the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired. The Company assesses whether debt instruments which are financial assets measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI, are credit-impaired at each reporting date. To assess if corporate debt instruments are credit impaired, the Company considers factors, such as bond yields, credit ratings and the ability of the borrower to raise funding. A loan is considered credit-impaired when a concession is granted to the borrower due to a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition, unless there is evidence that, as a result of granting the concession, the risk of not receiving the contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. For financial assets, where concessions are contemplated but not granted, the asset is deemed credit-impaired when there is observable evidence of credit-impairment, including meeting the definition of default. The definition of default includes unlikeliness to pay indicators and a back-stop, if amounts are overdue for 90 days or more
Significant Increase in Credit Risk
The Company monitors all financial assets, issued irrevocable loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are subject to the impairment requirements to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, since initial recognition. If there has been a significant increase in credit risk the Company will measure the loss allowance based on lifetime rather than 12-month ECL. The Company's accounting policy is not to use the practical expedient that the financial assets with 'low' credit risk at the reporting date are deemed not to have had a significant increase in credit risk. As a result, the Company monitors all financial assets, issued irrevocable loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are subject to impairment for significant increase in credit risk. In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date based on the remaining maturity of the instrument with the risk of a default occurring that was anticipated for the remaining maturity at the current reporting date when the financial instrument was first recognized. In making this assessment, the Company considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable, and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information, that is available without undue cost or effort, based on the Company's historical experience and expert credit assessment.
Given that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition is a relative measure, a given change, in' absolute terms, in the probability of default (PD) will be more significant for a financial instrument with sa lower Initial PD than compared to a financial Instrument with a higher PD.

ECL is calculated as under:
Stage 1: The Company calculates the 12 months' ECL based on the expectation of a default occurring within 12 months from the reporting date. The expected 12-month PD is applied to the EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted at the EIR.
Stage 2: When a loan has shown significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records an allowance for life time expected credit loss as above, but the PD and LGD is estimated over the lifetime of the loan. Stage 3: For loans considered credit impaired, life time ECL is recognized.
Offsetting of Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Write Off
Loans and Debt Securities are written off when the company has no reasonable expectations of recovering the financial asset (either in its entirety or a portion of it). This is the case when the Company determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts, subject to the write-off. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. The Company may apply enforcement activities to the financial assets written off. Recoveries resulting from the Company's enforcement activities will result in impairment gains and will be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.3.7 Derivative financial instruments
The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item. For hedging instrument, the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship
Hedge accounting
The Company makes use of derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. In order to manage particular risks, the Company applies hedge accounting for transactions that meet specified criteria.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge, the hedging/economic relationship, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, hedge ratio and how the Company would assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument's fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are assessed on an on-going basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were 0

Cash Flow Hedges
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit and loss. For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is initially recognized directly in OCI within equity (cash flow hedge reserve). The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in Finance Cost in the statement of profit and loss. When the hedged cash flow affects the statement of profit and loss, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or expense line of the statement of profit and loss. When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss that has been recognized in OCI at that time remains in OCI and is recognized when the hedged forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the statement of profit and loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in OCI is immediately transferred to the statement of profit and loss. The Company's hedging policy only allows for effective hedging relationships to be considered as hedges as per the relevant Ind-AS. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Company enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the terms of the hedged item, and so a qualitative and quantitative assessment of effectiveness is performed.
Fair Value Hedges
Fair value hedges hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss.
For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the cumulative change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in Finance Costs. Meanwhile, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item in the balance sheet and is also recognised in the statement of profit and loss in Finance Cost.
The Company classifies a fair value hedge relationship when the hedged item (or group of items) is a distinctively identifiable asset or liability hedged by one or a few hedging instruments. The financial instruments hedged for interest rate risk in a fair value hedge relationship is fixed rate debt issued and other borrowed funds. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or where the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is discontinued prospectively. If the relationship does not meet hedge effectiveness criteria, the Company discontinues hedge accounting from the date on which the qualifying criteria are no longer met. For hedged items recorded at amortised cost, the accumulated fair value hedge adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item on termination of the hedge accounting relationship is amortised over the remaining term of the original hedge using the recalculated EIR method by recalculating the EIR at the date when the amortisation begins. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
3.4 Taxes
_Income tax comprises of current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised based on tax rates and tax laws enacted, or substantively enacted, at the reporting date and on any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. It is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it orelates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax IsARE MUMBAI. recognised in the same statement as the related item appears Deferred tax is recognised for temporary

differences between the accounting base of assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet, and their tax bases. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date by the Company and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset basis the criteria given under Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes'.
3.5 Property, plant and equipment ('PPE')
PPE are held for use in supply of services and for administrative purpose, used for more than one period and not held for sale in the normal course of business. PPE and Capital work-in-progress ('CWIP') are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate only if it is probable that the expenditure incurred with increase the future economic benefits / functionality capability of the asset and that the cost of the item can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced and resulting gain / loss, if any, is recognized in other income / expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year the asset is derecognized. All other repair and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation, estimated useful life and residual value
The depreciation is calculated on straight line method using the useful lives as estimated by management. Depreciation on assets purchased during the period is provided on pro rata basis from the date asset is available for use as intended by management. Item of PPE is derecognized upon disposal, when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. The residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation of PPE are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively.
The Company has used below estimated useful lives to provide depreciation and amortization on its Property, plant and equipment.

Further, Company has made policy of considering the assets costing less than Rs. 10,000 as operating expenses.
The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used. Consequently, the useful life of certain vehicles and software differ from the life prescribed in Schedule Il of the Act. Vehicles are depreciated over the estimated useful life of 4 years which is lower than those indicated in schedule II.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
3.6 Other Intangible Assets and Amortization
Intangible assets are assets without physical substance, controlled by Company as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow. Intangible asset includes computer software. Intangible assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an intangible asset comprises of all directly attributable costs.
Such intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful life of these intangible assets is estimated at 5 years with zero residual value. Amortization on assets purchased during the year is provided on pro rata basis from the date asset is available for use. The residual values, useful lives and method of amortization are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively.
Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as "Intangible assets under development.
Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.
3.7 Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Assets
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit or loss.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
Contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
KAPADIA &
A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is liability that cannot be recognized Obecause it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statement.

Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realized.
3.8 Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency at the rates of exchange on the reporting date. Exchange difference on restatement of all other monetary items are recognized as Derivative assets/liabilities.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. These are reviewed at each year end and reflect the best current estimate.
3.9 Leases
The Company as a lessee
The Company's lease assets primarily consist of leases for buildings. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes right - of - use ("ROU") asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short term leases) and low value leases. For these short term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the under lying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair & value less.cost to sell and the value in use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset

generates cash flows that are largely dependent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment on exercise of an extension or a termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.
3.10 Fair Value Measurement
The Company measures financial instruments such as investment in mutual funds at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
- In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another marker participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
Fair value hierarchy
Ind AS 107, 'Financial Instrument - Disclosure' requires classification of the valuation method of financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, using three level fair-value-hierarchy (which reflects the significance of inputs used in the measurements). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to un-adjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to un-observable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair-value- hierarchy under Ind AS 107 are described below:
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level BADone or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level. This is the case for unlisted equity securities included in level 3.

3.11 Statement of Cash Flows
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.
3.12 Earnings Per Share
Basic Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to Equity Shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Earnings considered in ascertaining the EPS is the net profit for the year and any attributable tax thereto for the year.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
3.13 Events after the reporting period
Events after the reporting period are those events, both favorable and unfavorable that occur between end of the reporting period and the date on which the financial statements are approved for issue.
Adjusting Events
Events which provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period are adjusting events. Financials have been adjusted for those events.
Non-adjusting Events
Events which are of indicative of conditions that arise after the end of the reporting period are Non- adjusting events. Disclosure of the nature of event and estimate of its financial effect have been made in the financial statements.
3.14 Segment Reporting
Operating business segment results are reviewed regularly by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Business segment is the primary segment comprising of 'Financing activity'. As the Company operates only in a single business segment, no segment information thereof is given as required under Ind AS 108.
3.15 Material accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of Ind AS financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Judgments
In the process of applying the accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

a) Business model assessment
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Company's continuous assessment of whether the business model for which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets.
b) Fair Value of Financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
c) Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method
The Company's EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and penalty interest and charges). This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the instruments, as well expected changes to India's base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the instrument.
d) Impairment of financial asset
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes which can result in different levels of allowances. It has been the Company's policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when necessary. The impairment loss on loans and advances is disclosed in more detail in Note 30.
e) Provisions and other contingent liabilities
The Company operates in a regulatory and legal environment that, by nature, has a heightened element of litigation risk inherent to its operations. As a result, it is involved in various litigation, arbitration and proceedings in the ordinary course of the Company's business. When the Company can reliably measure the outflow of economic benefits in relation to a specific case and considers such outflows to be probable,
the Company records a provision against the case. Where the probability of outflow is considered to be harteret Acc B. Accountants

remote, or probable, but a reliable estimate cannot be made, a contingent liability is disclosed. Given the subjectivity and uncertainty of determining the probability and amount of losses, the Company takes into account a number of factors including legal advice, the stage of the matter and historical evidence from similar incidents. Significant judgement is required to conclude on these estimates.
f) Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.
g) Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit plans and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Ministry of Corporate Affairs, via a notification dated 9th September 2024, announced amendments to the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.Key revisions include the introduction of new provisions related to leaseback transactions under Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 116. The amendments will be applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1st April 2024.
Ministry of Corporate Affairs ('MCA') notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On August 12, 2024, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notified Ind AS 117, "Insurance Contracts," amending the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, to be effective from April 1, 2024.
Management has assessed the above amendments and is of the view that these amendments are not impacting to the Company.

The Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and trade payables approximated their carrying value largely due to short term maturities of these instruments.
Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates and individual creditworthiness of the counterparty. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for expected losses of these receivables. Accordingly, fair value of such instruments is not materially different from their carrying amounts
Valuation principles
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique.
Level 1:
Investments in Government securities and Debt securities, Held for Trading are measured based on their quoted prices.
Level 2:
Fair value of debt securities, borrowings other than debt securities and subordinated liabilities have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows discounting rate near to report date based on comparable rate / market observable data.
Level 3:
Fair value of loans have estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using discount rate equal to the rate near to the reporting date of the comparable product.

33 The Company is obligated under various capital contracts, Capital contracts are work/purchase orders of a capital nature, which have been committed. Estimated amounts of contracts remaining to be executed on intangible assets aggregated to ₹ 920.94 lakhs at March 31, 2025 (March 31, 2024: Gross - ₹ 1,165.66 lakhs)
34 Various tax related legal proceedings are pending against the Company at various levels of appeal either with the tax authorities or in the courts. Where after considering all available information in the opinion of management a liability requires accrual, the Company accrues such liability. Where such proceedings are sufficiently advanced to enable management to assess that a liability exists and are subject to reasonable estimation, management records its best estimate of such liability. Where a reasonable range of potential outcomes is estimated, management records its best estimate, or in the absence of a basis for selecting a specific estimate within a range, management records a liability no less than the lower end of the estimated range. The contested tax demands are adjusted by the tax authorities against refunds due to the Company on favorable resolution of earlier year's appeals/completion of assessments or paid. The payment/adjustment does not prejudice the outcome of the appeals filed by the Company. The advance tax payments are recorded as advance tax payments.
At March 31, 2025, the Company has assessed its contingent tax liability at an aggregate amount of ₹ 26.40 lakhs pertaining to income tax demands by the Government of India's tax authorities for past years (March 31, 2024: ₹ 742.61 lakhs). Based on consultation with counsel and favorable decisions in the Company's own or other cases, the management believes that the tax authorities are not likely to be able to substantiate their tax assessments and accordingly, has not provided for these tax demands at March 31, 2025.
The key disputed subject matter are detailed below:
a. Shortfall in TDS Payment.
b. Disallowance of club membership fees.
There are three cases against the Company which have not been acknowledged as debt, which is amounting to ₹ 218.11 Lakhs

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the projected benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the projected benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same method as applied in calculating the projected benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.
c) The Company does not have any leave encashment policy for its employees.

44. Risk Management
Risk Profile
The Company has operations within India. It is exposed to various kind of risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, business risk, etc. While risk is inherent to the Company's activities, it is managed through a comprehensive risk management framework that includes identification of risks and laying out of controls in the form of various risk limits to prudently monitor and manage different risks to ensure resilience. Risk management is critical to the Company's continuing profitability and sustainable growth.
Risk Management Structure
The Board of Directors are responsible for the overall risk management approach, approving the risk management strategies & principles, and exercise of oversight on establishment, monitoring & integration of risk management framework within organization.
The Risk Management Committee of the Board has the responsibility for development of the risk strategy & risk appetite and implementing principles, policies and limits. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing risk related decisions and monitoring risk levels.
The Risk Department is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk policies and limits.
Business units are primarily responsible for management of risk in their units, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment of risks of transactions. Exceptions / breach of limits are reported to the management and the Risk Management Committee.
The Treasury Department is responsible for managing the liabilities and the overall capital structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks.
The Risk management processes are audited annually by the internal auditors, which examine the adequacy of the processes and compliance with the limits. The internal auditors discuss the results of all assessments with the management. Observations and recommendations of the internal auditors are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board.
The Company's capital management guidelines ensure maintenance and management of prudent capital levels to support the desired balance sheet growth and provide a cushion against unexpected losses.
Managing liquidity positions is vital for the Company's effective operations. The management monitors the liquidity position on an ongoing basis and also examines how liquidity requirements are likely to evolve under different scenarios. The Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO), inter-alia comprising of Managing Director & CEO, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer, considers the current economic and market environment, near-term business growth projections and long-term strategic business decisions for determining the appropriate mix of funding sources to ensure liquidity is managed prudently.

Risk Measurement and Reporting
Monitoring and controlling risks is performed through compliance against the limits established by the Company at different levels. These limits reflect the business strategy of the Company, market environment in which the Company operates as well as the level of risk the Company is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on exposure to selected sectors/category of customers, liquidity position and capital adequacy position. Information in this regard is presented to the senior management on a monthly basis and to the Risk Management Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis.
Excessive Risk Concentration
Concentration arises when Company has exposure to a number of counterparties that are engaged in similar business activities or operate in the same region or have similar features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. In order to avoid excessive concentration of risk, the Company's policies include limits / guidelines on maintaining a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss because its borrowers fail to fulfil their contractual obligations. The Company has robust underwriting mechanism for loans and investments. It manages and controls its credit risk by setting limits on the amount of exposure for individual counterparties & groups, products, geographies, etc. and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits. It actively uses collaterals to reduce the credit risk. Credit quality review of individual exposures is undertaken for timely identification of deterioration in creditworthiness of counterparties, including that of collaterals. Portfolio level reviews are also undertaken as part of risk management framework to effectively manage credit risk at a macro level.
Impairment Assessment
a) Definition of Default and Cure
The Company considers a loan as defaulted and therefore classified as Stage 3 (credit impaired) for ECL calculation in all cases when EMI is overdue for more than 90 days on its contractual payments. Also, any loan facility which has been restructured / where the Company has exercised forbearance is considered as Stage 3.
As part of qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers other instances that may indicate unlikeliness to pay.
An asset classified as Stage 3 when EMI is overdue for more than 90 days on its contractual payments shall be moved out from Stage 3 upon payment of all irregularities. Restructured assets shall be moved out from Stage 3 on adherence of restructuring terms, subject to a cooling period of 1 year.
b) Probability of Default (PD) Estimation
It is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. In order to estimate / source the PDs, studies on defaults by external rating agencies available in public domain and experience of the Parent (Axis Bank Limited) have been taken into account.

c) Exposure at Default (EAD)
EAD is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayment of principal and interest, whether contractually scheduled or otherwise and expected drawdown on committed loan facilities and accrued interest from missed payments.
d) Loss Given Default (LGD)
LGD is an estimate of the loss arising in case where a default occurs. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company would expect to receive, including from the realization of any collateral.
Significant Increase in Credit Risk
The Company considers an exposure to have significantly increase in credit risk when the borrower exceeds 30 days past due on its contractual payments.
As part of qualitative assessment of whether a customer is exhibiting significant increase in credit risk, the Company also considers other instances that may indicate that there has been a significant deterioration in the customer's ability and willingness to pay.
Grouping Financial Assets
The Company calculates Expected Credit Loss (ECL) for loan assets at an individual client basis, based on the nature of the loan product. ECL for other assets and all Stage 3 assets is also calculated on an individual basis.
Analysis of Risk Concentration
The Company's risk concentration is managed by client / counterparty limits. The maximum credit exposure to any client or counterparty was ₹29,890.814* lakhs as at March 31, 2025 (March 31, 2024 ₹31,500.00 lakhs). Total exposure to 20 largest customers constituted 10.01% of the Company's total credit exposure as at March 31, 2025.

Collateral and Other Credit Enhancements
In order to mitigate the credit risk, the Company obtains collaterals, depending upon the assessment of credit risk at the individual loan account level. The Company has adopted guidelines for valuation and acceptability of each type of collateral.
Collateral obtained include debentures, bonds, debt mutual fund units, real estate properties, fixed assets, escrow of specific receivables / cash flows. The Company also obtains personal / corporate guarantees from key promoters and parent / group companies for loans to their subsidiaries / group companies.
The management monitors the market value of collateral and additional collateral is obtained in case of a breach in the stipulated security cover in accordance with the loan agreement.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Company might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due, as a result of mismatches in the timing of cash flows. The Company has arranged for funding through diversified sources and adopted a policy of managing cash flows and monitoring liquidity through various measures like limits on cumulative mismatches, stock ratios etc. to limit this risk. The Company has also adopted a Contingency Funding Plan, which is tested on an annual basis and the test results are placed before the Risk Management Committee of the Board.
Company manages its liquidity risk in line with its Board approved policies which contain conditions laid down by the regulator and ensures availability of adequate liquidity cushion in case of stressed market environment.
Prepayment Risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Company will incur a financial loss because its customers repay earlier than contracted. The Company has an option to levy a pre-payment penalty in such cases, wherever sanction terms provide for the same.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as interest rates and equity prices. The Company held Government securities as part of its Trading Portfolio during the year. The trading position is monitored regularly by the Risk department as part of Interest Rate Risk Management and adherence to stop loss limits is ensured.

Interest Rate Risk
The Company has set up an Earnings at Risk limit for managing the Interest Rate Risk in the lending book which is monitored by the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
The Gap i.e. the difference between Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive Liabilities (RSL) for each time bucket upto 1 year is used as a measure of interest rate sensitivity. A Gap Report is generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities, assets and off-balance sheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next re-pricing period, whichever is earlier. A positive Gap indicates that RSAs are more than RSLs whereas negative Gap indicates that RSLs are more than RSAs. Limits have been defined in Asset Liability Management policy to monitor the position of gaps in each bucket.
The following table indicates the sensitivity of Net Interest Income to interest rate shocks as per Earnings at Risk model that considers AFL's Rate sensitive assets and Rate sensitive liabilities up to 1 year time buckets:
Increase / Decrease
in basis points
+/- 20 bps
+/- 30 bps
Sensitivity of
Net Interest Income 2024-25
- ₹2118 lakhs / + ₹2118 lakhs
-₹3178 lakhs / + ₹3178 lakhs
Sensitivity of Net Interest Income 2023-24
- ₹1926 lakhs / + ₹1926 lakhs
-₹2889 lakhs / + ₹2889 lakhs
Foreign Currency Risk
Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency risk for the Company arises majorly on account of foreign currency borrowings. The Company manages this foreign currency risk by entering into cross currency swaps and forward contract. When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being as hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match with the terms of the hedge exposure. The Company's policy is to fully hedge its foreign currency borrowings at the time of drawdown and remain so till repayment. The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as cross currency interest rate swap to mitigate risk of changes in exchange rate in foreign currency and floating interest rate. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in market place.
Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, people or external events. Operational risk can lead to financial and reputational loss or have legal or regulatory implications when controls fail to operate effectively. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks. However, it manages these risks through a control framework. Controls include defined process and framework across all units, system access, authorization and reconciliation procedures and assessment processes such as the use of internal audit and concurrent audit.
Impairment of Financial Assets
The Company records allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) for all loans and debt investments, together with loan commitments to customers.

(All amounts are in rupees lakhs, except per share data and as stated otherwise)
The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset, unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case the allowance is based on the 12 months' expected credit loss. Both life time expected credit loss and 12 months' expected credit loss are calculated on individual loan / instrument basis.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs an assessment of whether the loan's / investment's credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the asset.
Based on the above, the Company categorises its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as under:
Stage 1: When loans are first recognised, the Company recognises an allowance based on 12 months' expected credit loss. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been re- classified from Stage 2.
Stage 2: When a loan has shown significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records an allowance for the life time expected credit loss. Stage 2 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been re-classified from Stage 3.
Stage 3: When a loan is credit impaired, the Company records an allowance for the credit loss basis loss given default.
Calculation of Expected Credit Losses (ECL)
The Company calculates ECL to measure the expected cash shortfall, discounted at the Effective Interest Rate (EIR). Expected cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are contractually due to the Company and cash flows that the Company expects to receive.
Key elements considered for ECL calculation are as under:
Probability of Default (PD): It is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. In order to estimate the PDs, studies on defaults available in public domain and experience of the Parent Company (Axis Bank Limited) have been taken into account.
Exposure at Default (EAD): EAD is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayment of principal and interest, whether contractually scheduled or otherwise and expected drawdown on committed loan facilities and accrued interest from missed payments
Loss Given Default (LGD): LGD is an estimate of the loss arising in case where a default occurs. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company would expect to receive, including from the realization of any security.
ECL is calculated as under:
Stage 1: The Company calculates the 12 months' ECL based on the expectation of a default occurring within 12 months from the reporting date. The expected 12-month PD is applied to the EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted at the EIR.
Stage 2: When a loan has shown significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records an allowance for life time expected credit loss.

Stage 3: For loans considered credit impaired, life time ECL is recognized.
The Company also adopts a loss- based approach to calculate ECL for assets predominantly secured by listed / quoted financial securities.
Forward Looking Information
In computation of ECL, the Company considers historical loss rates on the portfolio over a period which covers most external factors such as equity prices, property prices, collateral valuations, interest rates, etc. The management believes that there is no correlation directly with external events on loan repayment by the customers. Accordingly, no analysis has been performed.
Collateral Valuation
To mitigate the credit risk on loans / investments, the Company seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral may be in the form of receivables, mutual funds, bonds, real estate and guarantees.
Fair value of the collateral affects the calculation of ECL. It is assessed at inception of the loan and re-assessed every 3 years as per internal guidelines. However, quoted financial securities are valued daily.
Write-offs
Financial assets are written-off either partially or in their entirety when the Company has stopped pursuing recovery or where the chances of recovery are low. The Company has written-off loans to the extent of Rs. 4612.28 lakhs during the year (Previous Year: 3047.55).

ii) Foreign Currency Risk
Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency risk for the Company arise majorly on account of foreign currency borrowings. The Company manages this foreign currency risk by entering in to cross currency swaps and forward contract. When a derivative is entered in to for the purpose of being as hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match with the terms of the hedge exposure. The Company's policy is to fully hedge its foreign currency borrowings at the time of drawdown and remain so till repayment.
1
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as cross currency interest rate swap to mitigate risk of changes in exchange rate in foreign currency and floating interest rate. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in market place.

The Company does not indulge into any derivative trading transactions.

The Company evaluates all the risks inherent in the transaction viz., counter party risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, basis risk etc.
ii) Credit risk is controlled by restricting the counterparties that the Company deals with, to those who either have banking relationship with the Company or are internationally renowned or can provide sufficient information. Market/ Price risk arising from the fluctuations of interest rates and foreign exchange rates or from other factors shall be closely monitored and controlled. Normally transaction entered for hedging, will run over the life of the underlying instrument, irrespective of profit or loss. Liquidity risk is controlled by restricting counterparties to those who have adequate facility, sufficient information, and sisable trading capacity and capability to enter into transactions in any markets around the world.
iii) The respective functions of trading, confirmation and settlement should be performed by different personnel. The front office and back-office role is well defined and segregated. All the derivatives transactions is quarterly monitored and reviewed.

70. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FY 2024-25)
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had introduced Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) (effective from December 01, 2020) as part of Liquidity Risk Management Framework (LRMF) to ensure that a NBFC has adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a significant liquidity stress lasting for a period of 30 days. LCR is defined as a ratio of HQLA to the total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days. As on March 31, 2025, the applicable minimum LCR required to be maintained by the Company is 100.00%.
The Company's liquidity strategy is managed by the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) which is an Executive Level Committee. Meetings of the ALCO are held on a monthly basis and minutes of the same are placed before the Risk Management Committee of the Board for noting. The Risk Management Committee (RMC), a sub-committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, along with Chief Risk Officer being the permanent invitee, oversees the liquidity risk management. The minutes of RMC are placed before the Board of Directors for noting and discussion.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Axis Finance Limited maintained daily average HQLA (after applicable haircut) of ₹ 1,19,171.51 Lakhs. The daily average LCR of Axis Finance Limited for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was 319.78.% (The daily average LCR of Axis Finance for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was 260.23% ). HQLA primarily includes Government securities viz. Central and State Government securities and small portion in eligible corporate bonds and commercial papers with mandated haircuts applied thereto.
The weighted cash outflows are primarily driven by secured funding which includes debt obligations on NCDs and bank borrowings. The total weighted cash inflows are primarily driven by performing exposures and lines of credit from Axis Bank Limited ("Parent Company").
