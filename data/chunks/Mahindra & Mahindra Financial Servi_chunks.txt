SME disbursements grew 50%+, while tractors (-3%), PV (-3% in Q2), CV (-1%), and three-wheelers (-1%) saw flat or negative growth. Used vehicles up 2%. Loan Book: Grew 20% YoY, driven by strong disbursements in FY '23 and FY '24. Asset Quality: Gross Stage 3 (GS3) at 3.8%, up 20 bps QoQ but down 50 bps YoY. 40% of GS3 increase from tractors due to delayed cash flows in agrarian states (e.g., MP, Maharashtra, Gujarat, AP, Telangana). GS2 + GS3 at 10.3%, expected to fall below 10% by FY '25 end. GNPA (IRAC norms): INR 6,000 crores (~5.3%) vs. Stage 3 INR 4,309 crores (~3.8%). Credit cost: H1 at 1.9%, Q2 at 2.3%, projected to end FY '25 at 1.3%-1.5%. End losses reduced from INR 2,500 crores (FY '22) to INR 1,700 crores (FY '24), expected to decline further. Provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 59.5%, expected to moderate as COVID-era data exits ECL models. Net Interest Margins (NIMs): Stable at 6.5%, with H1 at 6.5% and FY '25 guidance of 6.5%-6.7%. Yields up 30 bps QoQ (20 bps loan income, 10 bps fee income from insurance agency). Cost of funds unchanged, with incremental COF stable but stock-level COF slow to adjust. Profitability: PPOP up 27% YoY, PAT up 57% in Q2 and 50% in H1. ROA at 1.5% in H1, expected to reach 1.8%-2% by FY '25 end (vs. Mission '25 aspiration of 2.5%). Operating Expenses: Down to 2.6% from 2.8%, with cost-to-income ratio at ~40% (vs. 43% peak). Target range: 38%-40%. Capital Adequacy: CRAR down 180 bps QoQ due to dividend payout and 5.7% asset growth. Tier 1 at ~15% (vs. 9% regulatory floor), no equity raise planned in FY '25. Business and Operational Highlights Mission '25 Aspirations (Set in FY '22): Asset Quality: GS3 below threshold at 3.8%, credit cost trending toward 1.3%-1.5%. Book Growth: On track for 2x AUM from FY '22 levels, supported by prior disbursements. Operational Efficiency: Opex trending down, supported by digital and process improvements. Diversification: Non-wheels business at 6% of AUM (vs. 15% target), with MSME and leasing showing progress. Mortgage and insurance agency licenses to aid future growth. ROA: Targeting 2% by FY '25 end, below 2.5% aspiration. Festive Season (October 2024): Marginal improvement vs. last year, with tractors showing early signs of recovery. Awaiting Dhanteras/Diwali numbers for clearer trends. Digital and Tech: New LOS and LMS (Salesforce) implemented. NTC scorecards and BRE enhanced for wheels business, set to go live soon. Talent Augmentation: Mahesh (CRO, ex-HDFC/Yes Bank), Jaspreet Chadha (CBO Mortgages, ex-Bajaj Finance), Bijoy (CBO Leasing, ex-Axis Bank), Mod Singh (ex-RBI), and Devendra (Chief Analytics Officer) joined to strengthen leadership. Rural Housing (MRHFL): GS3 at ~9% (down from 12% YoY), flat QoQ. Focus on collections, not growth. Employee base reduced from 10,000 to 6,500. Exited low-ticket housing loans. Target GS3 of 5.5%-6% in 2 quarters, with Jaspreet seconded to lead stabilization. Segment Performance Tractors: 40% of GS3 spike due to delayed cash flows from late monsoons. Half-yearly repayments for agrarian borrowers impacted; monthly repayment borrowers (haulage + agri) less stressed. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season. Passenger Vehicles (PV): Flat YoY, down 3% in Q2. NTC and near-prime segments offer growth potential with improved underwriting. Commercial Vehicles (CV): Flat YoY, with small CVs seeing delays among self-employed borrowers. Used Vehicles: Up 2%, contributing 18% to disbursements. Focus on used cars, tractors, and CVs to boost yields. SME: Strong 50%+ growth, though small base. Key driver for diversification. Three-Wheelers: Down 1%, minimal overlap with MFI borrowers. Outlook and Priorities for FY '25 and Beyond Growth: FY '25 disbursements likely flattish or up to 4% (vs. earlier low-teen guidance).

SME disbursements grew 50%+, while tractors (-3%), PV (-3% in Q2), CV (-1%), and three-wheelers (-1%) saw flat or negative growth. Used vehicles up 2%. Loan Book: Grew 20% YoY, driven by strong disbursements in FY '23 and FY '24. Asset Quality: Gross Stage 3 (GS3) at 3.8%, up 20 bps QoQ but down 50 bps YoY. 40% of GS3 increase from tractors due to delayed cash flows in agrarian states (e.g., MP, Maharashtra, Gujarat, AP, Telangana). GS2 + GS3 at 10.3%, expected to fall below 10% by FY '25 end. GNPA (IRAC norms): INR 6,000 crores (~5.3%) vs. Stage 3 INR 4,309 crores (~3.8%). Credit cost: H1 at 1.9%, Q2 at 2.3%, projected to end FY '25 at 1.3%-1.5%. End losses reduced from INR 2,500 crores (FY '22) to INR 1,700 crores (FY '24), expected to decline further. Provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 59.5%, expected to moderate as COVID-era data exits ECL models. Net Interest Margins (NIMs): Stable at 6.5%, with H1 at 6.5% and FY '25 guidance of 6.5%-6.7%. Yields up 30 bps QoQ (20 bps loan income, 10 bps fee income from insurance agency). Cost of funds unchanged, with incremental COF stable but stock-level COF slow to adjust. Profitability: PPOP up 27% YoY, PAT up 57% in Q2 and 50% in H1. ROA at 1.5% in H1, expected to reach 1.8%-2% by FY '25 end (vs. Mission '25 aspiration of 2.5%). Operating Expenses: Down to 2.6% from 2.8%, with cost-to-income ratio at ~40% (vs. 43% peak). Target range: 38%-40%. Capital Adequacy: CRAR down 180 bps QoQ due to dividend payout and 5.7% asset growth. Tier 1 at ~15% (vs. 9% regulatory floor), no equity raise planned in FY '25. Business and Operational Highlights Mission '25 Aspirations (Set in FY '22): Asset Quality: GS3 below threshold at 3.8%, credit cost trending toward 1.3%-1.5%. Book Growth: On track for 2x AUM from FY '22 levels, supported by prior disbursements. Operational Efficiency: Opex trending down, supported by digital and process improvements. Diversification: Non-wheels business at 6% of AUM (vs. 15% target), with MSME and leasing showing progress. Mortgage and insurance agency licenses to aid future growth. ROA: Targeting 2% by FY '25 end, below 2.5% aspiration. Festive Season (October 2024): Marginal improvement vs. last year, with tractors showing early signs of recovery. Awaiting Dhanteras/Diwali numbers for clearer trends. Digital and Tech: New LOS and LMS (Salesforce) implemented. NTC scorecards and BRE enhanced for wheels business, set to go live soon. Talent Augmentation: Mahesh (CRO, ex-HDFC/Yes Bank), Jaspreet Chadha (CBO Mortgages, ex-Bajaj Finance), Bijoy (CBO Leasing, ex-Axis Bank), Mod Singh (ex-RBI), and Devendra (Chief Analytics Officer) joined to strengthen leadership. Rural Housing (MRHFL): GS3 at ~9% (down from 12% YoY), flat QoQ. Focus on collections, not growth. Employee base reduced from 10,000 to 6,500. Exited low-ticket housing loans. Target GS3 of 5.5%-6% in 2 quarters, with Jaspreet seconded to lead stabilization. Segment Performance Tractors: 40% of GS3 spike due to delayed cash flows from late monsoons. Half-yearly repayments for agrarian borrowers impacted; monthly repayment borrowers (haulage + agri) less stressed. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season. Passenger Vehicles (PV): Flat YoY, down 3% in Q2. NTC and near-prime segments offer growth potential with improved underwriting. Commercial Vehicles (CV): Flat YoY, with small CVs seeing delays among self-employed borrowers. Used Vehicles: Up 2%, contributing 18% to disbursements. Focus on used cars, tractors, and CVs to boost yields. SME: Strong 50%+ growth, though small base. Key driver for diversification. Three-Wheelers: Down 1%, minimal overlap with MFI borrowers. Outlook and Priorities for FY '25 and Beyond Growth: FY '25 disbursements likely flattish or up to 4% (vs. earlier low-teen guidance). Book growth projected at ~18% due to prior disbursements. Medium-term (3-year) aspiration: Mid-teen disbursement CAGR, driven by wheels (maintaining market share) and new businesses (SME, leasing, mortgages). Margins: NIMs to improve to 6.5%-6.7% in FY '25 via higher IRRs (PV, used vehicles, tractors), fee income, and stable COF. No significant COF relief assumed. Asset Quality: Credit cost guidance: 1.3%-1.5% for FY '25, medium-term range of 1.2%-1.5%. Focus on controlling slippages (H1 at ~INR 1,500 crores, similar to FY '24 full year) via enhanced collections and analytics. GS3 and GS2 + GS3 to moderate in H2 with improved rural cash flows. Diversification: Non-wheels AUM targeted at 15%+ in the medium term, with SME, leasing, and mortgages as key drivers. Co-lending with SBI, Bank of Baroda, and others to target prime PV/CV customers, aiming for INR 25-40 crores monthly throughput per partner. Operational Efficiency: Cost-to-income ratio to stay at 38%-40%, balancing new business investments with fee income growth. Enhanced collection intensity to counter macro challenges, with analytics-driven tools and repossession efficiency reducing end losses. Rural Housing: Prioritize asset quality (GS3 to 5.5%-6%) over growth, with organizational rationalization ongoing. Q&A Key Points Tractor Stress: Delays, not defaults, driven by late monsoons impacting agrarian states. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season and aligned repayment schedules. Disbursement Growth: Muted due to weak underlying demand in wheels segments, not a conscious pullback. SME an outlier with strong growth.

Rural Housing (MRHFL): GS3 at ~9% (down from 12% YoY), flat QoQ. Focus on collections, not growth. Employee base reduced from 10,000 to 6,500. Exited low-ticket housing loans. Target GS3 of 5.5%-6% in 2 quarters, with Jaspreet seconded to lead stabilization. Segment Performance Tractors: 40% of GS3 spike due to delayed cash flows from late monsoons. Half-yearly repayments for agrarian borrowers impacted; monthly repayment borrowers (haulage + agri) less stressed. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season.

Asset Quality: Credit cost guidance: 1.3%-1.5% for FY '25, medium-term range of 1.2%-1.5%. Focus on controlling slippages (H1 at ~INR 1,500 crores, similar to FY '24 full year) via enhanced collections and analytics. GS3 and GS2 + GS3 to moderate in H2 with improved rural cash flows. Diversification: Non-wheels AUM targeted at 15%+ in the medium term, with SME, leasing, and mortgages as key drivers.

Operational Efficiency: Cost-to-income ratio to stay at 38%-40%, balancing new business investments with fee income growth. Enhanced collection intensity to counter macro challenges, with analytics-driven tools and repossession efficiency reducing end losses. Rural Housing: Prioritize asset quality (GS3 to 5.5%-6%) over growth, with organizational rationalization ongoing. Q&A Key Points Tractor Stress: Delays, not defaults, driven by late monsoons impacting agrarian states. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season and aligned repayment schedules. Disbursement Growth: Muted due to weak underlying demand in wheels segments, not a conscious pullback. SME an outlier with strong growth.

SME disbursements grew 50%+, while tractors (-3%), PV (-3% in Q2), CV (-1%), and three-wheelers (-1%) saw flat or negative growth. Used vehicles up 2%. Loan Book: Grew 20% YoY, driven by strong disbursements in FY '23 and FY '24. Asset Quality: Gross Stage 3 (GS3) at 3.8%, up 20 bps QoQ but down 50 bps YoY. 40% of GS3 increase from tractors due to delayed cash flows in agrarian states (e.g., MP, Maharashtra, Gujarat, AP, Telangana). GS2 + GS3 at 10.3%, expected to fall below 10% by FY '25 end. GNPA (IRAC norms): INR 6,000 crores (~5.3%) vs. Stage 3 INR 4,309 crores (~3.8%). Credit cost: H1 at 1.9%, Q2 at 2.3%, projected to end FY '25 at 1.3%-1.5%. End losses reduced from INR 2,500 crores (FY '22) to INR 1,700 crores (FY '24), expected to decline further. Provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 59.5%, expected to moderate as COVID-era data exits ECL models. Net Interest Margins (NIMs): Stable at 6.5%, with H1 at 6.5% and FY '25 guidance of 6.5%-6.7%. Yields up 30 bps QoQ (20 bps loan income, 10 bps fee income from insurance agency). Cost of funds unchanged, with incremental COF stable but stock-level COF slow to adjust. Profitability: PPOP up 27% YoY, PAT up 57% in Q2 and 50% in H1. ROA at 1.5% in H1, expected to reach 1.8%-2% by FY '25 end (vs. Mission '25 aspiration of 2.5%). Operating Expenses: Down to 2.6% from 2.8%, with cost-to-income ratio at ~40% (vs. 43% peak). Target range: 38%-40%. Capital Adequacy: CRAR down 180 bps QoQ due to dividend payout and 5.7% asset growth. Tier 1 at ~15% (vs. 9% regulatory floor), no equity raise planned in FY '25. Business and Operational Highlights Mission '25 Aspirations (Set in FY '22): Asset Quality: GS3 below threshold at 3.8%, credit cost trending toward 1.3%-1.5%. Book Growth: On track for 2x AUM from FY '22 levels, supported by prior disbursements. Operational Efficiency: Opex trending down, supported by digital and process improvements. Diversification: Non-wheels business at 6% of AUM (vs. 15% target), with MSME and leasing showing progress. Mortgage and insurance agency licenses to aid future growth. ROA: Targeting 2% by FY '25 end, below 2.5% aspiration. Festive Season (October 2024): Marginal improvement vs. last year, with tractors showing early signs of recovery. Awaiting Dhanteras/Diwali numbers for clearer trends. Digital and Tech: New LOS and LMS (Salesforce) implemented. NTC scorecards and BRE enhanced for wheels business, set to go live soon. Talent Augmentation: Mahesh (CRO, ex-HDFC/Yes Bank), Jaspreet Chadha (CBO Mortgages, ex-Bajaj Finance), Bijoy (CBO Leasing, ex-Axis Bank), Mod Singh (ex-RBI), and Devendra (Chief Analytics Officer) joined to strengthen leadership. Rural Housing (MRHFL): GS3 at ~9% (down from 12% YoY), flat QoQ. Focus on collections, not growth. Employee base reduced from 10,000 to 6,500. Exited low-ticket housing loans. Target GS3 of 5.5%-6% in 2 quarters, with Jaspreet seconded to lead stabilization. Segment Performance Tractors: 40% of GS3 spike due to delayed cash flows from late monsoons. Half-yearly repayments for agrarian borrowers impacted; monthly repayment borrowers (haulage + agri) less stressed. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season. Passenger Vehicles (PV): Flat YoY, down 3% in Q2. NTC and near-prime segments offer growth potential with improved underwriting. Commercial Vehicles (CV): Flat YoY, with small CVs seeing delays among self-employed borrowers. Used Vehicles: Up 2%, contributing 18% to disbursements. Focus on used cars, tractors, and CVs to boost yields. SME: Strong 50%+ growth, though small base. Key driver for diversification. Three-Wheelers: Down 1%, minimal overlap with MFI borrowers. Outlook and Priorities for FY '25 and Beyond Growth: FY '25 disbursements likely flattish or up to 4% (vs. earlier low-teen guidance). Book growth projected at ~18% due to prior disbursements. Medium-term (3-year) aspiration: Mid-teen disbursement CAGR, driven by wheels (maintaining market share) and new businesses (SME, leasing, mortgages). Margins: NIMs to improve to 6.5%-6.7% in FY '25 via higher IRRs (PV, used vehicles, tractors), fee income, and stable COF. No significant COF relief assumed. Asset Quality: Credit cost guidance: 1.3%-1.5% for FY '25, medium-term range of 1.2%-1.5%. Focus on controlling slippages (H1 at ~INR 1,500 crores, similar to FY '24 full year) via enhanced collections and analytics. GS3 and GS2 + GS3 to moderate in H2 with improved rural cash flows. Diversification: Non-wheels AUM targeted at 15%+ in the medium term, with SME, leasing, and mortgages as key drivers. Co-lending with SBI, Bank of Baroda, and others to target prime PV/CV customers, aiming for INR 25-40 crores monthly throughput per partner. Operational Efficiency: Cost-to-income ratio to stay at 38%-40%, balancing new business investments with fee income growth. Enhanced collection intensity to counter macro challenges, with analytics-driven tools and repossession efficiency reducing end losses. Rural Housing: Prioritize asset quality (GS3 to 5.5%-6%) over growth, with organizational rationalization ongoing. Q&A Key Points Tractor Stress: Delays, not defaults, driven by late monsoons impacting agrarian states. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season and aligned repayment schedules. Disbursement Growth: Muted due to weak underlying demand in wheels segments, not a conscious pullback. SME an outlier with strong growth. MFI Stress: Minimal overlap with MFI borrowers, primarily in three-wheelers, but no significant stress observed. Fee Income: Structural growth from insurance agency (6 partners across life, health, motor), expected to sustain and grow. ECL Coverage: Reviewed quarterly, with PD/LGD refresh. Coverage (59.5%) to decline in H2 as COVID-era data exits, aiding credit cost reduction. Slippages: Higher in H1 (~INR 1,500 crores) vs. FY '24 full year, but credit cost to moderate via recoveries and lower LGD. No artificial provision releases. Geographical Trends: East (Kolkata region) disbursements down 200 bps due to Northeast risk review (post-Mizoram incident) and weak market throughput. Capital Adequacy: No equity raise needed in FY '25, with Tier 1 at ~15%. CRAR decline due to dividend and asset growth. Yield Pass-Through: Steady increase in PV segment IRRs in Q1/Q2, with used vehicles aiding yield improvement. No specific quantum disclosed. Closing Remarks Q2 faced challenges from macro headwinds and rural cash flow disruptions, particularly in tractors.

SME disbursements grew 50%+, while tractors (-3%), PV (-3% in Q2), CV (-1%), and three-wheelers (-1%) saw flat or negative growth. Used vehicles up 2%. Loan Book: Grew 20% YoY, driven by strong disbursements in FY '23 and FY '24. Asset Quality: Gross Stage 3 (GS3) at 3.8%, up 20 bps QoQ but down 50 bps YoY. 40% of GS3 increase from tractors due to delayed cash flows in agrarian states (e.g., MP, Maharashtra, Gujarat, AP, Telangana). GS2 + GS3 at 10.3%, expected to fall below 10% by FY '25 end. GNPA (IRAC norms): INR 6,000 crores (~5.3%) vs. Stage 3 INR 4,309 crores (~3.8%). Credit cost: H1 at 1.9%, Q2 at 2.3%, projected to end FY '25 at 1.3%-1.5%. End losses reduced from INR 2,500 crores (FY '22) to INR 1,700 crores (FY '24), expected to decline further. Provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 59.5%, expected to moderate as COVID-era data exits ECL models. Net Interest Margins (NIMs): Stable at 6.5%, with H1 at 6.5% and FY '25 guidance of 6.5%-6.7%. Yields up 30 bps QoQ (20 bps loan income, 10 bps fee income from insurance agency). Cost of funds unchanged, with incremental COF stable but stock-level COF slow to adjust. Profitability: PPOP up 27% YoY, PAT up 57% in Q2 and 50% in H1. ROA at 1.5% in H1, expected to reach 1.8%-2% by FY '25 end (vs. Mission '25 aspiration of 2.5%). Operating Expenses: Down to 2.6% from 2.8%, with cost-to-income ratio at ~40% (vs. 43% peak). Target range: 38%-40%. Capital Adequacy: CRAR down 180 bps QoQ due to dividend payout and 5.7% asset growth. Tier 1 at ~15% (vs. 9% regulatory floor), no equity raise planned in FY '25. Business and Operational Highlights Mission '25 Aspirations (Set in FY '22): Asset Quality: GS3 below threshold at 3.8%, credit cost trending toward 1.3%-1.5%. Book Growth: On track for 2x AUM from FY '22 levels, supported by prior disbursements. Operational Efficiency: Opex trending down, supported by digital and process improvements. Diversification: Non-wheels business at 6% of AUM (vs. 15% target), with MSME and leasing showing progress. Mortgage and insurance agency licenses to aid future growth. ROA: Targeting 2% by FY '25 end, below 2.5% aspiration. Festive Season (October 2024): Marginal improvement vs. last year, with tractors showing early signs of recovery. Awaiting Dhanteras/Diwali numbers for clearer trends. Digital and Tech: New LOS and LMS (Salesforce) implemented. NTC scorecards and BRE enhanced for wheels business, set to go live soon. Talent Augmentation: Mahesh (CRO, ex-HDFC/Yes Bank), Jaspreet Chadha (CBO Mortgages, ex-Bajaj Finance), Bijoy (CBO Leasing, ex-Axis Bank), Mod Singh (ex-RBI), and Devendra (Chief Analytics Officer) joined to strengthen leadership. Rural Housing (MRHFL): GS3 at ~9% (down from 12% YoY), flat QoQ. Focus on collections, not growth. Employee base reduced from 10,000 to 6,500. Exited low-ticket housing loans. Target GS3 of 5.5%-6% in 2 quarters, with Jaspreet seconded to lead stabilization. Segment Performance Tractors: 40% of GS3 spike due to delayed cash flows from late monsoons. Half-yearly repayments for agrarian borrowers impacted; monthly repayment borrowers (haulage + agri) less stressed. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season. Passenger Vehicles (PV): Flat YoY, down 3% in Q2. NTC and near-prime segments offer growth potential with improved underwriting. Commercial Vehicles (CV): Flat YoY, with small CVs seeing delays among self-employed borrowers. Used Vehicles: Up 2%, contributing 18% to disbursements. Focus on used cars, tractors, and CVs to boost yields. SME: Strong 50%+ growth, though small base. Key driver for diversification. Three-Wheelers: Down 1%, minimal overlap with MFI borrowers. Outlook and Priorities for FY '25 and Beyond Growth: FY '25 disbursements likely flattish or up to 4% (vs. earlier low-teen guidance). Book growth projected at ~18% due to prior disbursements. Medium-term (3-year) aspiration: Mid-teen disbursement CAGR, driven by wheels (maintaining market share) and new businesses (SME, leasing, mortgages). Margins: NIMs to improve to 6.5%-6.7% in FY '25 via higher IRRs (PV, used vehicles, tractors), fee income, and stable COF. No significant COF relief assumed. Asset Quality: Credit cost guidance: 1.3%-1.5% for FY '25, medium-term range of 1.2%-1.5%. Focus on controlling slippages (H1 at ~INR 1,500 crores, similar to FY '24 full year) via enhanced collections and analytics. GS3 and GS2 + GS3 to moderate in H2 with improved rural cash flows. Diversification: Non-wheels AUM targeted at 15%+ in the medium term, with SME, leasing, and mortgages as key drivers. Co-lending with SBI, Bank of Baroda, and others to target prime PV/CV customers, aiming for INR 25-40 crores monthly throughput per partner. Operational Efficiency: Cost-to-income ratio to stay at 38%-40%, balancing new business investments with fee income growth. Enhanced collection intensity to counter macro challenges, with analytics-driven tools and repossession efficiency reducing end losses. Rural Housing: Prioritize asset quality (GS3 to 5.5%-6%) over growth, with organizational rationalization ongoing. Q&A Key Points Tractor Stress: Delays, not defaults, driven by late monsoons impacting agrarian states. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season and aligned repayment schedules. Disbursement Growth: Muted due to weak underlying demand in wheels segments, not a conscious pullback. SME an outlier with strong growth. MFI Stress: Minimal overlap with MFI borrowers, primarily in three-wheelers, but no significant stress observed. Fee Income: Structural growth from insurance agency (6 partners across life, health, motor), expected to sustain and grow. ECL Coverage: Reviewed quarterly, with PD/LGD refresh. Coverage (59.5%) to decline in H2 as COVID-era data exits, aiding credit cost reduction. Slippages: Higher in H1 (~INR 1,500 crores) vs. FY '24 full year, but credit cost to moderate via recoveries and lower LGD. No artificial provision releases. Geographical Trends: East (Kolkata region) disbursements down 200 bps due to Northeast risk review (post-Mizoram incident) and weak market throughput. Capital Adequacy: No equity raise needed in FY '25, with Tier 1 at ~15%. CRAR decline due to dividend and asset growth. Yield Pass-Through: Steady increase in PV segment IRRs in Q1/Q2, with used vehicles aiding yield improvement. No specific quantum disclosed. Closing Remarks Q2 faced challenges from macro headwinds and rural cash flow disruptions, particularly in tractors. Asset quality remains a top priority, with intensified collection efforts and a war room setup akin to post-COVID. Growth to be balanced with margins and risk, leveraging green shoots in tractors and SME. Optimistic about festive season (Diwali) boosting volumes. Committed to achieving FY '25 targets (1.8%-2% ROA, 1.3%-1.5% credit cost, 18% book growth) while building resilience for medium-term aspirations.
