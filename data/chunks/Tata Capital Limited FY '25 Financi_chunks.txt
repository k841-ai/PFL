Equity Issuance: Allotted 1,83,86,74,95 fully paid-up equity shares (₹10 each) to TMF Holdings Limited, shareholder of TMFL, pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement effective May 8, 2025. Amalgamation: TMFL merged with TCL, effective April 1, 2024, under Sections 230-232 of the Companies Act, 2013. Assets and liabilities of TMFL recorded at fair value per Ind AS 103. Q3 FY '25 (Dec 31, 2024) results reflect the merged entity but are unaudited/unreviewed. Compliance and Disclosures SEBI Listing Regulations: Disclosures under Regulation 52(4) included with financial results. Security Cover Certificate provided per Regulation 54. Statements confirming utilization of Non-Convertible Debenture proceeds and nil deviation/variation submitted per Regulations 52(7) and 52(7A). Related Party Transactions disclosed for H2 FY '25 per Regulation 62K(9). Large Corporate Disclosures submitted per SEBI Master Circular (May 22, 2024). Auditors: Jointly audited by M S K A & Associates and M P Chitale & Co., with an unmodified opinion. Audit conducted per Standards on Auditing under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Emphasis of Matter: Highlighted the TMFL amalgamation, with no modification to the opinion. Notes and Limitations The document lacks specific figures for expenses, profit before tax, tax expense, and net profit, as these are not included in the provided pages. Q3 FY '25 (Dec 31, 2024) results are unaudited/unreviewed due to the merger, and Q4 FY '25 results are derived as a balancing figure from audited full-year and unaudited YTD figures. FY '24 comparative figures are pre-merger, limiting direct YoY comparability. Asset growth, particularly in loans and derivatives, is significantly influenced by the TMFL merger. Additional Context The amalgamation of TMFL has expanded TCL’s loan book and operational scope, likely driving the sharp increase in interest income and assets. The company’s focus on compliance with SEBI regulations is evident through comprehensive disclosures and auditor certifications. The dividend recommendation signals confidence in FY '25 performance, though the modest ₹0.42 per share reflects prudent capital management post-merger.
