Business and Operational Highlights
Mission '25 Aspirations (Set in FY '22):
Asset Quality: GS3 below threshold at 3.8%, credit cost trending toward 1.3%-1.5%.
Book Growth: On track for 2x AUM from FY '22 levels, supported by prior disbursements.
Operational Efficiency: Opex trending down, supported by digital and process improvements.
Diversification: Non-wheels business at 6% of AUM (vs. 15% target), with MSME and leasing showing progress. Mortgage and insurance agency licenses to aid future growth.
ROA: Targeting 2% by FY '25 end, below 2.5% aspiration.
Festive Season (October 2024):
Marginal improvement vs. last year, with tractors showing early signs of recovery. Awaiting Dhanteras/Diwali numbers for clearer trends.
Digital and Tech:
New LOS and LMS (Salesforce) implemented.
NTC scorecards and BRE enhanced for wheels business, set to go live soon.
Talent Augmentation:
Mahesh (CRO, ex-HDFC/Yes Bank), Jaspreet Chadha (CBO Mortgages, ex-Bajaj Finance), Bijoy (CBO Leasing, ex-Axis Bank), Mod Singh (ex-RBI), and Devendra (Chief Analytics Officer) joined to strengthen leadership.
Rural Housing (MRHFL):
GS3 at ~9% (down from 12% YoY), flat QoQ. Focus on collections, not growth.
Employee base reduced from 10,000 to 6,500. Exited low-ticket housing loans.
Target GS3 of 5.5%-6% in 2 quarters, with Jaspreet seconded to lead stabilization.
Segment Performance
Tractors: 40% of GS3 spike due to delayed cash flows from late monsoons. Half-yearly repayments for agrarian borrowers impacted; monthly repayment borrowers (haulage + agri) less stressed. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season.
Passenger Vehicles (PV): Flat YoY, down 3% in Q2. NTC and near-prime segments offer growth potential with improved underwriting.
Commercial Vehicles (CV): Flat YoY, with small CVs seeing delays among self-employed borrowers.
Used Vehicles: Up 2%, contributing 18% to disbursements. Focus on used cars, tractors, and CVs to boost yields.
SME: Strong 50%+ growth, though small base. Key driver for diversification.
Three-Wheelers: Down 1%, minimal overlap with MFI borrowers.
Outlook and Priorities for FY '25 and Beyond
Growth:
FY '25 disbursements likely flattish or up to 4% (vs. earlier low-teen guidance). Book growth projected at ~18% due to prior disbursements.
Medium-term (3-year) aspiration: Mid-teen disbursement CAGR, driven by wheels (maintaining market share) and new businesses (SME, leasing, mortgages).
Margins:
NIMs to improve to 6.5%-6.7% in FY '25 via higher IRRs (PV, used vehicles, tractors), fee income, and stable COF.
No significant COF relief assumed.
Asset Quality:
Credit cost guidance: 1.3%-1.5% for FY '25, medium-term range of 1.2%-1.5%.
Focus on controlling slippages (H1 at ~INR 1,500 crores, similar to FY '24 full year) via enhanced collections and analytics.
GS3 and GS2 + GS3 to moderate in H2 with improved rural cash flows.
Diversification:
Non-wheels AUM targeted at 15%+ in the medium term, with SME, leasing, and mortgages as key drivers.
Co-lending with SBI, Bank of Baroda, and others to target prime PV/CV customers, aiming for INR 25-40 crores monthly throughput per partner.
Operational Efficiency:
Cost-to-income ratio to stay at 38%-40%, balancing new business investments with fee income growth.
Enhanced collection intensity to counter macro challenges, with analytics-driven tools and repossession efficiency reducing end losses.
Rural Housing: Prioritize asset quality (GS3 to 5.5%-6%) over growth, with organizational rationalization ongoing.
Q&A Key Points
Tractor Stress: Delays, not defaults, driven by late monsoons impacting agrarian states. Recovery expected in Q3/Q4 with rabi season and aligned repayment schedules.
Disbursement Growth: Muted due to weak underlying demand in wheels segments, not a conscious pullback. SME an outlier with strong growth.
MFI Stress: Minimal overlap with MFI borrowers, primarily in three-wheelers, but no significant stress observed.
Fee Income: Structural growth from insurance agency (6 partners across life, health, motor), expected to sustain and grow.
ECL Coverage: Reviewed quarterly, with PD/LGD refresh. Coverage (59.5%) to decline in H2 as COVID-era data exits, aiding credit cost reduction.
Slippages: Higher in H1 (~INR 1,500 crores) vs. FY '24 full year, but credit cost to moderate via recoveries and lower LGD. No artificial provision releases.
Geographical Trends: East (Kolkata region) disbursements down 200 bps due to Northeast risk review (post-Mizoram incident) and weak market throughput.
Capital Adequacy: No equity raise needed in FY '25, with Tier 1 at ~15%. CRAR decline due to dividend and asset growth.
Yield Pass-Through: Steady increase in PV segment IRRs in Q1/Q2, with used vehicles aiding yield improvement. No specific quantum disclosed.
Closing Remarks
Q2 faced challenges from macro headwinds and rural cash flow disruptions, particularly in tractors.
Asset quality remains a top priority, with intensified collection efforts and a war room setup akin to post-COVID.
Growth to be balanced with margins and risk, leveraging green shoots in tractors and SME.
Optimistic about festive season (Diwali) boosting volumes.
Committed to achieving FY '25 targets (1.8%-2% ROA, 1.3%-1.5% credit cost, 18% book growth) while building resilience for medium-term aspirations.
