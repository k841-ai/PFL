Notes and Limitations
The document lacks specific figures for expenses, profit before tax, tax expense, and net profit, as these are not included in the provided pages.
Q3 FY '25 (Dec 31, 2024) results are unaudited/unreviewed due to the merger, and Q4 FY '25 results are derived as a balancing figure from audited full-year and unaudited YTD figures.
FY '24 comparative figures are pre-merger, limiting direct YoY comparability.
Asset growth, particularly in loans and derivatives, is significantly influenced by the TMFL merger.
Additional Context
The amalgamation of TMFL has expanded TCL’s loan book and operational scope, likely driving the sharp increase in interest income and assets.
The company’s focus on compliance with SEBI regulations is evident through comprehensive disclosures and auditor certifications.
The dividend recommendation signals confidence in FY '25 performance, though the modest ₹0.42 per share reflects prudent capital management post-merger.
